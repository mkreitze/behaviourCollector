# behaviourCollector
This git project contains a method to visually display all behaviours detected by a phase portrait of a 2 state FBCA. The code used to generate phase portraits can be accessed [here](https://github.com/mkreitze/mastersThesis).

The following is each phase portrait with associated found behaviours.
